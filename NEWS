Version 0.3.0

  * Add SHA256 hash calculator based on code from the FreeBSD project. That
    code is (naturally) licensed under the simplified/2-clause BSD license so
    the library is now MIT/BSD-licensed.

  * Implement path::realize() which on POSIX calls realpath(3).

  * Recognize MSVC target triplet (*-microsoft-win32-msvcXX.Z).

  * Derive a target class from the target triplet for some targets. Currently
    the classes are: 'linux', 'macosx', 'freebsd', 'windows', and 'other'.


Version 0.2.0

  * First public release.
